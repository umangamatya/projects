This is my Master's Degree thesis project. The title of my thesis is "Node Filtering and Face Routing in Sensor Network". I developed the simulating software in Java. It contains 3 projects. I tried to filter redundant nodes present in a sensor network when nodes are connected and face routing is used for routing messages in a network.

All the details about my thesis is present in this link.
