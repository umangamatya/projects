This is a music player developed by me. I have used sqlite database and windows media player plugins. I developed it on c#. You can add music folders, play single music, create playlist, play playlist. 

Note: After installing the setup file, you need to press (shift + right mouse button) and run the program as "Run as administrator". If you try to run it in normal way, then the database won't work and you won't be able to save playlist. You can still play songs.

You can open song, open folder and open playlist. When your songs are added on playlist, you can save it by clicking the right mouse button on the playlist. You can add selected songs or all songs on the playlist.

Its very simple to install. Just click the setup.exe and you are done.
